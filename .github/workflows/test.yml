# Reusable workflow to be called from other repos.
# Uses the third party 'add-to-project' action to add 'depfu' PRs
# to the Technical Debt project board.
# Requires a GitHub Personal Access Token to be passed in as a secret named 'token'.
# Calling workflows should be triggered on pull_request events with a label.
# This specific pull request is then the one added to the project - it doesn't scan all open PRs.
# See LabWhere .github/workflows for an example of how to use this workflow.
